# Full Stack Open 2021 – Projects & Learnings

Welcome! This repository contains my work through the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by the University of Helsinki. It includes solutions and projects from Parts 0 to 9, while Parts 10 to 13 are hosted in separate repositories—linked within the relevant sections below.

The course is a deep dive into modern full stack web development. It covers front-end and back-end technologies, DevOps, testing, mobile development, and more. While each part is estimated to take 20 hours, I typically spent 25–40 hours per part to deepen my understanding and fine-tune my code for readability and maintainability.
